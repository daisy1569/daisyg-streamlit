st.write("Climate change is strengthening wildfire frequency and intensity across the globe. Wildfire destruction is not limited to property and infrastructure, but extends to human health and other complex global interactions. Oftentimes, wildfires in one area of the globe can have harmful far reaching impacts across continents. The mission of this project team is to use AI and reinforcement learning to create new optimized options for wildfire mitigation. However, two things will be focused on to achieve this goal.")

st.write("Firstly, we aim to develop a reinforcement learning program that successfully effectively allocates firefighting resources to aid decision-makers. Secondly, and of equal importance, we intend to create simulation software to assess various wildfire scenarios and evaluate whether the AI program performs better than human interventions in historical situations. The latter is the main focus of my research project and individual contribution to the greater project team.")
